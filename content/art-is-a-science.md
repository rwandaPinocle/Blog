"Art best serves us when it highlights something you might have otherwise missed or never noticed."
- Niel DeGrasse Tyson

The core of science is measurement.
We pick a phenomenon, measure it, and use those measurements to inform and falsify theories.

In the physical world, we can measure things directly with experiments and sophisticated instrumentation.

Psychology has a problem though, we cannot directly measure the human mind.
The *brain*, yes, but the mind is different.

Art is to psychology what telescopes are to astronomers.

The people that measure the mind are not scientists or engineers, but artists.
Art is not merely a collection of items.
Art, like science, is best defined by it's sociology.
In art education, artists take time to study a set of community-consensus fundamentals.
The sociology of art is isomorphic to the sociology of science.
The result of this community art process is that artists now produce art that "shaped like" the human mind.
For instance, by studying storytelling conventions, we learn what kinds of narratives people are easily able to remember.
We learn that events are best communicated with distinct characters, clear conflicts, and resolutions to those conflicts.

Music theory tells us that
1. Our aural systems are extremely responsive to the range of a high pitched human voice.
   This is the range violins occupy and the most popular pop music vocal range.
2. We have a special set of memory in our brains specifically for audio.
3. Rhythm is fundamental to how we percieve time.
   We are extremely sensitive to rhythms that are slightly off.
4. For some reason, the pentatonic scale is universal.
   Probably related to the how the 12 tone scale can be constructed by pinching vibrating strings in half.

Visual art tells us
1. The mathematics of linear perspective
2. Our perception of distance is based on color (mountains being faded), overlap, perspective, and prior knowledge of sizes.
3. Our perception of form is based on silouhette and shadow.
4. Cartoons tell us that we are highly sensitive to relative proportions of babies and children and are hardwired to like them.
5. we conflate size with importance and attention. people tend to draw faces to large. Egyptian art made this explicit, with larger figures being more important than small figures 
6. Neoteny

Video Games
1. We are motivated by short, tight, feedback loops.
2. Nagivating 3d dimensional space is highly intuitive.
3. ergonomics of controllers
4. variable ratio rewards
