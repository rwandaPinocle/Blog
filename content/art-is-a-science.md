What is the value of art?
What exactly do we get out of it, if anything at all?
A common answer is that art is pleasurable both to create and to consume which alone makes it worth doing.
Fair enough.
After all, who doesn't enjoy sitting down with our friends and families and watching the latest movie or listening to a classic rock album.
The arts are an enriching and harmless activity that need little justification beyond the fact that we enjoy partaking of it.
But let's consider a slightly different question.
What does art contribute to human knowledge?
Unlike the physical sciences, art has not shed light on the mysteries beyond our planet.
No painter has ever discovered an unknown species or proved a new theorem by putting her brush to a canvas.
Nor is that a fair criticism!
I doubt Walt Disney or his audience ever gave a single thought to what people would learn from his cartoons.
Frankly, it's obvious to most people, even artists, that their work is strictly aesthetic.
Pleasing to experience, perhaps eye-wateringly beautiful, but nothing beyond that.
Art stimulates the senses and stirs the emotions but does not reveal any facts that we did not already know.
In other words, art has nothing to offer the natural sciences.

I argue that this is false.
Art does not merely have emotional content (though that alone makes it worthwhile) but offers us a unique kind of scientific instrument.
In the same way that telescopes allow us to measure the night sky, art offers us a means of measuring the human mind.
Further, this knowledge is exclusive to the arts.
Inaccessible to the scientist through any means other than breifly becoming an artist.
I will first show this in the abstract by discussing the philosophy of science and drawing parallels to the history of western art.
Then I will provide several concrete examples from the fields of illustration, music theory, and video games.

# Puzzles and Progress

This one shows the best upper bound mathematicians were able to prove for the twin prime conjecture after Yitang Zhang published the first result in 2013.

And lastly, this is a best speedrun times for the game "Celeste" since 2017.

"Art best serves us when it highlights something you might have otherwise missed or never noticed."
- Niel DeGrasse Tyson

The core of science is measurement.
We pick a phenomenon, measure it, and use those measurements to inform and falsify theories.

In the physical world, we can measure things directly with experiments and sophisticated instrumentation.
Telescopes let us measure the stars.
Microscopes let us measure the things beneath our feet.

Psychology has a problem though, we cannot directly measure the human mind.
The *brain*, yes, but the mind is different.

Art is to psychology what telescopes are to astronomers.

The people that measure the mind are not scientists or engineers, but artists.
Art is not merely a collection of items.
Art, like science, is best defined by it's sociology.
In art education, artists take time to study a set of community-consensus fundamentals.
The sociology of art is isomorphic to the sociology of science.
The result of this community art process is that artists now produce art that "shaped like" the human mind.
For instance, by studying storytelling conventions, we learn what kinds of narratives people are easily able to remember.
We learn that events are best communicated with distinct characters, clear conflicts, and resolutions to those conflicts.

AI would struggle to produce something beautiful in a new medium because beauty is judged by the mind.
Diffusion algorithms mere optimize for an objective that is already extremely well measured by existing artists.
It would have no knowledge of the parts of the mind measured by new mediums.

# Knowledge that is exclusive to the arts
1. Brandon Sanderson talks about the approximate lengths that certain stories can be before the audience loses interest.
2. The hollywood formula tells how how much time should be between story beats for audiences to understand them.

Music theory tells us that
1. Our aural systems are extremely responsive to the range of a high pitched human voice.
   This is the range violins occupy and the most popular pop music vocal range.
2. We have a special set of memory in our brains specifically for audio.
3. Rhythm is fundamental to how we percieve time.
   We are extremely sensitive to rhythms that are slightly off.
4. For some reason, the pentatonic scale is universal.
   Probably related to the how the 12 tone scale can be constructed by pinching vibrating strings in half.

Visual art tells us
1. The mathematics of linear perspective
2. Our perception of distance is based on color (mountains being faded), overlap, perspective, and prior knowledge of sizes.
3. Our perception of form is based on silouhette and shadow.
4. Neoteny: Cartoons tell us that we are highly sensitive to relative proportions of babies and children and are hardwired to like them.
5. we conflate size with importance and attention. people tend to draw faces to large. Egyptian art made this explicit, with larger figures being more important than small figures 

Video Games
1. We are motivated by short, tight, feedback loops.
2. Nagivating 3d dimensional space is highly intuitive.
3. ergonomics of controllers
4. variable ratio rewards
